# SQL Database Projects

This repository contains the following:
  * **Database schemas with at least one or two tables** that have one-to-many / many-to-many relationships between them, created using SQL.
  * **SQL queries to databases** that read data from one table / joins, creates, updates or deletes new records.
  * **Integration of relational databases to various programs** through test-driven classes which implement CRUD methods and send SQL queries to databases.
  * **Programs that communicate with databases**, designed by creating sequence diagrams.
